# Sorting Algorithms in C
The premise of this is to show and demonstrate sorting algorithms within the C Language

Concepts and Areas Learnt and further developed:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>Sorting Algorithms</li>
  <li>Big O Notation, Best, Worst, Average cases</li>
  <li>How these algorithms work</li>
</ul>


I will be adding more algorithms over time!
